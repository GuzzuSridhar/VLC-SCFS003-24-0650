/*
Dropping a table in MySQL is a destructive operation that permanently removes the table and all its data from the database. 
This action cannot be undone.
Syntax
DROP TABLE table_name;

			Irreversibility: Dropping a table is irreversible. Once a table is dropped, its data and structure cannot be recovered.
			Foreign Key Constraints: If the dropped table is involved in foreign key relationships with other tables, the foreign key constraints will be checked. 
					If there are existing foreign key references to the dropped table, the drop operation will fail.
			Database Integrity: Dropping a table can affect the integrity of your database if it is referenced by other tables. 
					Ensure that you have considered the consequences of dropping a table before executing the command.
