/*
CREATE TABLE statement that includes various numeric data types in MySQL:

	INT: Integer, commonly used for IDs. It can store whole numbers from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647.
	TINYINT: Stores small integer values from -128 to 127, or 0 to 255 if unsigned.
	SMALLINT: Stores medium-sized integers from -32,768 to 32,767, or 0 to 65,535 if unsigned.
	MEDIUMINT: Stores larger integer values from -8,388,608 to 8,388,607, or 0 to 16,777,215 if unsigned.
	BIGINT: Stores very large integers from -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807.
     ---------------------- DECIMAL TYPES --------------------------------
	DECIMAL(m, d): Fixed-point number where m is the total number of digits and d is the number of digits after the decimal point. Itâ€™s ideal for precise financial data.
	FLOAT(m, d): Floating-point number with less precision than DOUBLE. m is the total number of digits and d is the number after the decimal.
	DOUBLE(m, d): Double precision floating-point number with higher precision than FLOAT.
	NUMERIC(m, d): Synonym for DECIMAL in MySQL, used for fixed-point precision.
    
    numeric data types like INT, FLOAT, DECIMAL, etc., can be defined as signed or unsigned. The default behavior for numeric types is signed, meaning they can hold both positive and negative values.
    Signed: The default, allows negative, zero, and positive values.
	Unsigned: Only allows zero and positive values, which increases the range of positive numbers that can be stored.
