/*
CREATE TABLE statement in MySQL that includes various date and time types:
	DATE: Stores only the date in the format YYYY-MM-DD. This is useful for storing birthdates, event dates, etc.
		Example: '2024-09-04'
	TIME: Stores only the time in the format HH:MM:SS. Useful for recording specific times without dates.
		Example: '14:30:00' (2:30 PM)
	DATETIME: Stores both date and time in the format YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS. It does not automatically update or track changes, but is useful for recording an event or action that involves both date and time.
		Example: '2024-09-04 14:30:00'
	TIMESTAMP: Stores both date and time, much like DATETIME, but has the added benefit of automatic handling of current time on creation and updates. Itâ€™s often used for tracking record creation and updates.
		Example: '2024-09-04 14:30:00'
