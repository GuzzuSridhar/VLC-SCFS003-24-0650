/*
The ROW_NUMBER() function in MySQL is a window function that assigns a unique sequential integer to rows within a result set. 
This integer represents the rowâ€™s position within its partition, based on the specified ORDER BY clause. 
It is often used for tasks such as ranking results or identifying specific rows in a set.
Syntax
ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
    PARTITION BY partition_column
    ORDER BY order_column
) AS alias_name
	PARTITION BY partition_column: (Optional) Divides the result set into partitions (groups) to which the ROW_NUMBER() function is applied. Each partition's row numbering starts at 1.
	ORDER BY order_column: Defines the order in which rows are assigned their unique numbers within each partition.
	AS alias_name: Assigns an alias to the result of the ROW_NUMBER() function.
    
    Unique Numbers: ROW_NUMBER() guarantees a unique sequential number for each row within its partition. 
    If there are ties (i.e., rows with the same value in the ORDER BY column), each row still receives a unique number.
	Order of Rows: The order specified in the ORDER BY clause affects the sequence of the row numbers. Changing the order will result in different row numbers.
